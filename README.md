   - What design process did you follow for your project work?
   - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
2. How do I approach developing programs?
   - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
   - How did iteration factor into your development?
   - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
   - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
   
When I design software, a fair amount of planning is necessary before I ever get started writing code. This project was no different. Throughout all of the learning modules, we laid plans to build each aspect of the project progressively. For example, our initial step was to take a picture of some objects and plan out how we thought to build them. Then, we had to build the first object. Then, we added a texture and so on. One thing that I wish that I had done for this project was use GitHub for version control throughout. This would have helped me keep up with changes more efficiently throughout the development cycle of the project as there were multiple iterations of the project throughout. Moving forward in future classes, I will use GitHub as a version control system to allow me to keep track of the changes made to the applications that I create.

Computational graphics and visualization have opened up a gateway of knowledge to multiple educational and professional pathways. Prior to this course, I had very little experience with graphical libraries and building graphical applications. These concepts and techniques have given me experience to pursue other avenues such as game design or building models for medical applications or other areas that require visual representation.
